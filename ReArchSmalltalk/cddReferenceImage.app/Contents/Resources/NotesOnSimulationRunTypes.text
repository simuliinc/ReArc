Notes on carrying out simulationsCode in any window can be executed by highlighting it and pressing command-p on a Mac or Alt-p on a PC. Execution can be interrupted by command-. on a Mac or Alt-. on a PC Code is provided to construct a one area cortex with a number of three layer columns. Each layer has a number of pyramidal neurons. There is a large random element to the initial connectivity of the cortex, so identical runs will generally produce different results. There are also a number of parameters that can be controlled, listed in the file "Parameters". The code in this file must be executed prior to any run to set parameters at selected values.Code for two types of runs is provided: type A and type B. Paramers are set the the methd [SettingParameters] which must be run immediately before the appropriate Brainrun.In type A runs:There are 42 presentations of sequences of instances of 10 categories. The categories are always presented in the same sequential order throughout the 420 presentations. Recommendation weights (in the basal ganglia) are learned in presentations 201-300 using code in window [CalculationOfColumnWeightsInFavourOfTenCategories]. Learning is guided by both feedback if identification is wrong and identification of the correct category. Category recognitions are then tested in presentations 301-400 using code on window [CategoryIdentifications]. The numbers of correct first choices, correct second choices and correct third choices can be calculated using code in window [CountingCorrectCategory1st2ndAnd3rdChoices] note1.In type B runs:There are 21 presentations of sequences of instances of 5 categories, then  21 presentations of sequences of instances of 5 different categories.  Finally there are 36 presentations of sequences of instances of all 10 categories. The categories are always presented in the same order throughout the 780 presentations. Recommendation weights (in the basal ganglia) for the first five categories are learned in presentations 101-150. Learning is guided by both feedback if identification is wrong and identification of the correct category. Category recognitions are then tested on presentations 151-200.Recommendation weights (in the basal ganglia) for the second five categories are learned in presentations 321-370. Learning is guided by both feedback if identification is wrong and identification of the correct category. Category recognitions for the extra five categories are then tested on presentations 371-420.With no further changes to the recommendation weights, category recognitions of all 10 categories are tested in presentations 421-520.In presentations 521-620, incorrect identifications are given feedback indicating they are incorrect but with no information on the correct category.Category recognitions of all 10 categories are then again tested in presentations 421-520.The number of correct first, second and third choice identifications can be calculated using the code in window [CountingCorrectCategory1stAnd2ndAnd3rdChoices] note1note1 When using the code in [CountingCorrectCategory1st2ndAnd3rdChoices], the stopPoint, numberOfCategories, and firstCategoryNumber parameters must first be set to their appropriate values. stopPoint is the number of presentations (generally 50 or 100); numberOfCategories is 5 or 10 depending on the presentations being tested; firstCategoryNumber is generally 1, but is 6 for the Type B run presentations of the second five categories.
